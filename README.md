# MongoDB Social Network
## Description
Want to make your own social media website to compete with the likes of Facebook or Twitter? Are you looking for a template of sorts to get you started? Look no further than this app!
### Why did I make this?
Let's face it: Many people today are fed up with social media websites like Twitter and Facebook selling their data and just gernally not respecting their privacy. There are many people out there who want to make their own social media platforms that prove to be viable alternatives to all the big names in social media. But the problem is that they don't know where, or how, to start out. So I created an app (the one you're currently viewing), operated by MongoDB, to help all those people get a head start on making thier social media apps a reality.
### What problem does this solve?
This helps lessen the amount of work needed to create a new social media application. Instead of trying to create a new app completely from scratch, you can try using this as a basic template and add any cool features you feel will enhance everyone's experience.
### What did I learn?
I learned that with MongoDB, I AM UNSTOPPABLE!!!

OK, but in all seriousness, I learned how to create and edit a database using MongoDB and Mongoose. MongoDB is sort of like a simpler version of MySQL, in that unlike MySQL, MongoDB doesn't require you to enter a password every time you want to use it, and MongoDB actually has a visual user interface via Compass and Atlas, which can be very useful to people who are just starting out on making databases.
